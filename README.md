Config files and dot-files for the grim ripper machine

Got the ideas for adding cover art from: http://www.andrews-corner.org/getalbumart.html

ogg-cover-art script came from: https://github.com/acabal/scripts/blob/master/ogg-cover-art

This install works best with 15.10. abcde needed to be at >=2.7 and I don't mind having the latest for this machine.
