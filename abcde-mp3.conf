# Options for ImageMagick commands used by album art processing when available

# Actions to take
# Comma-separated list of one or more of the following:
#  cddb,cue,read,normalize,encode,tag,move,playlist,clean,default
#   encode implies read
#   normalize implies read
#   tag implies cddb,read,encode
#   move implies cddb,read,encode,tag
#   playlist implies cddb
# An action can be added to the "default" action by specifying it along with
# "default", without having to repeat the default ones:
#  ACTIONS=default,playlist
# The default action list (referenced as "default") is defined in the following
# comment:
#ACTIONS=cddb,read,encode,tag,move,clean
ACTIONS=cddb,read,getalbumart,encode,tag,move,clean

# If you'd like to make a default location that overrides the current
# directory for putting mp3's, uncomment this.
OUTPUTDIR=~/Music

# Or if you'd just like to put the temporary .wav files somewhere else
# you can specify that here
WAVOUTPUTDIR=~/Music/wav

# OUTPUTTYPE can be either "ogg", "mp3", "flac" or "spx", or a combination
# of them separated with ",": "ogg,mp3".
OUTPUTTYPE=mp3

# Output filename format - change this to reflect your inner desire to
# organize things differently than everyone else :)
# You have the following variables at your disposal:
# OUTPUT, GENRE, ALBUMFILE, ARTISTFILE, TRACKFILE, and TRACKNUM.
# Make sure to single-quote this variable. abcde will automatically create
# the directory portion of this filename.
# NOTICE: OUTPUTTYPE has been deprecated in the OUTPUTFORMAT string.
# Since multiple-output was integrated we always append the file type
# to the files. Remove it from your user defined string if you are getting
# files like ".ogg.ogg".
OUTPUTFORMAT='${OUTPUT}/${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}-${TRACKNUM}-${TRACKFILE}'

# Like OUTPUTFORMAT but for Various Artists discs.
VAOUTPUTFORMAT='${OUTPUT}/Various/${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}-${TRACKNUM}-${ARTISTFILE}-${TRACKFILE}'

# Define how many encoders to run at once. This makes for huge speedups
# on SMP systems. Defaults to 1. Equivalent to -j.
MAXPROCS=6

# If set to y, enables batch mode normalization, which preserves relative
# volume differences between tracks of an album. 
#BATCHNORM=n

# Set the playlist file location format. Uses the same variables and format
# as OUTPUTFORMAT. If the playlist is specified to be in a subdirectory, it
# will be created for you and the playlist will reference files from that
# subdirectory.
#PLAYLISTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}.${OUTPUT}.m3u'
# If you want to prefix every filename in a playlist with an arbitrary
# string (such as 'http://you/yourstuff/'), use this option
#PLAYLISTDATAPREFIX=''

#Like PLAYLIST{FORMAT,DATAPREFIX} but for Various Artists discs:
#VAPLAYLISTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}.${OUTPUT}.m3u'
#VAPLAYLISTDATAPREFIX=''

# Custom filename munging:
# By default, abcde will do the following to CDDB data to get a useful
# filename:
# * Translate colons to a space and a dash for Windows compatibility
# * Eat control characters, single quotes, and question marks
# * Translate spaces and forward slashes to underscores
# To change that, redefine the mungefilename function.
# mungefilename receives the CDDB data (artist, track, title, whatever)
# as $1 and outputs it on stdout.
#mungefilename ()
#{
#       echo "$@" | sed s,:,\ -,g | tr \ / __ | tr -d \'\"\?\[:cntrl:\]
#}

#
# don't replace spaces with _
# elm
# 
mungefilename ()
{
	echo "$@" | sed s,:,\ -,g | tr / _ | tr -d \'\"\?\[:cntrl:\]
}

# Custom genre munging:
# By default we just transform uppercase to lowercase. Not much of a fancy
# function, with not much use, but one can disable it or just turn the first
# Uppercase.
mungegenre ()
{
	echo $CDGENRE | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]"
}

# If you'd like to have abcde eject the cdrom after all the tracks have been
# read, uncomment the following line.
